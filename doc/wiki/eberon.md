**Eberon** is Experimental oBERON. It is my attempt to make a programming language in the right way (in my humble opinion of cause) taking Wirth's Oberon as a start point.

Eberon extends original Oberon so any valid oberon program is also a valid eberon program. A new syntax was introduced for extensions but I tried to maintain the original syntax flavor (e.g. CAPS).

### Extensions
* [Methods](/vladfolts/oberonjs/wiki/eberon-methods)
* [Strings](/vladfolts/oberonjs/wiki/eberon-strings)
* [Record fields read-only export](/vladfolts/oberonjs/wiki/eberon-record-fields-read-only-export)
* [Procedure call result can be denoted](/vladfolts/oberonjs/wiki/eberon-procedure-call-result)
* Non-scalar variables (arrays and records) can be exported (forbidden in oberon for some unknown reason).
